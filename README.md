# Project Sturcture

This project initially is trying to demonstrate the conversion between UUID used in Java and Objective-C. 
However it turns out this project now shows data exchange by protobuf via MQTT.

For simplicity, this UUID is hardcoded in this demo.  
UUID: a3e3b0af-af85-4633-a0f5-0b10212bdabd



# 1. Protobuf file
## source 
## binary

# Server: Spring boot (java)


# Client 1: android

# Client 2: iOS (objective-C)
